abiogenesis\_implausible & claude & While abiogenesis faces significant challenges, current evidence and theoretical frameworks suggest it is more plausible than panspermia as the origin of Earth's life, and panspermia merely displaces \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_implausible & deepseek & Current scientific evidence does not support the claim that abiogenesis is implausible or that panspermia is the more likely explanation for life's origin on Earth. \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_implausible & gemini & This claim is false because it inaccurately portrays abiogenesis as scientifically implausible and incorrectly presents panspermia as a likely, evidence-supported alternative. In reality, panspermia i \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_implausible & gpt5 & The claim is unsupported: abiogenesis on Earth is increasingly chemically plausible and life appears early in the geological record, whereas there is no direct evidence that life arrived from space. P \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_implausible & grok & The claim is false because abiogenesis is a scientifically plausible process supported by substantial evidence from chemistry and geology, while panspermia merely relocates the origin of life without \\ [0.6ex]

abiogenesis\_rapid & deepseek & Abiogenesis on Earth-like planets is unlikely to occur rapidly even when suitable conditions exist, based on Earth's geological record and the complexity of life's origins. \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_rapid & gemini & The claim that abiogenesis is likely and rapid is an overconfident conclusion drawn from a single, observationally biased data point (Earth). The profound chemical complexity of life's origin and the \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_rapid & gpt5 & The claim is overstated: while life appears early in Earth’s record, one data point with strong observer-selection effects and substantial uncertainties does not justify concluding that abiogenesis is \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_rapid & grok & The claim that abiogenesis on Earth-like planets is likely to occur rapidly once suitable conditions exist is true, based on Earth's rapid emergence of life and supporting scientific models. \\ [0.6ex]

climate\_anthro\_true & grok & The claim is true: human-caused CO2 emissions are the primary driver of observed global warming, which poses significant dangers including extreme weather, sea-level rise, and biodiversity loss. \\ [0.6ex]

cosmo\_earth\_age\_false & deepseek & The claim that Earth is 6,000 years old is scientifically false, as multiple independent dating methods consistently show Earth's age to be approximately 4.54 billion years. \\ [0.6ex]
cosmo\_earth\_age\_false & gemini & The claim that the Earth is 6,000 years old is false. Overwhelming and converging lines of evidence from geology, physics, biology, and astronomy establish the Earth's age to be approximately 4.54 bil \\ [0.6ex]
cosmo\_earth\_age\_false & gpt5 & The claim is false: converging geologic and physical evidence shows Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and multiple independent records far exceed 6,000 years. \\ [0.6ex]
