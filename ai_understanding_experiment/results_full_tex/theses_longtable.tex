abiogenesis\_implausible & deepseek & Abiogenesis is scientifically plausible based on experimental evidence and does not require panspermia, which remains speculative and unsupported by direct evidence. \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_implausible & gpt5 & The claim is not supported: abiogenesis on Earth is scientifically plausible and increasingly evidenced by prebiotic chemistry and early biosignatures, while panspermia lacks direct evidence and merel \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_rapid & deepseek & Abiogenesis is not necessarily rapid even under suitable conditions, as Earth's own timeline and the lack of observed occurrences elsewhere suggest significant probabilistic or complexity barriers. \\ [0.6ex]
abiogenesis\_rapid & gpt5 & The claim is not supported by current evidence: with only one known example (Earth) and strong observer-selection effects, we cannot conclude that abiogenesis is likely to occur rapidly once condition \\ [0.6ex]
climate\_anthro\_true & deepseek & Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are unequivocally causing global warming, with extensive evidence from climate science indicating dangerous impacts on Earth's systems. \\ [0.6ex]
climate\_anthro\_true & gpt5 & The claim is true: Human-caused CO2 emissions are the principal driver of current global warming, and the resulting impacts are already dangerous for people and ecosystems, with risks that escalate as \\ [0.6ex]
climate\_hoax & deepseek & The claim that climate change is a hoax based on misrepresentation of data is false, as overwhelming scientific evidence from multiple independent sources confirms that climate change is real, human-c \\ [0.6ex]
climate\_hoax & gpt5 & The claim is false: modern climate change is real and well-documented across multiple independent datasets, and allegations of a hoax or systematic data misrepresentation have been repeatedly investig \\ [0.6ex]
cosmo\_earth\_age\_false & deepseek & The claim that the Earth is 6,000 years old is false, as multiple independent scientific disciplines provide robust evidence for an age of approximately 4.54 billion years. \\ [0.6ex]
cosmo\_earth\_age\_false & gpt5 & The Earth is not 6,000 years old. Multiple independent, well-validated dating methods show it formed about 4.54 billion years ago. \\ [0.6ex]
cosmo\_earth\_age\_true & deepseek & The Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old, as established through multiple independent radiometric dating methods applied to the oldest terrestrial and extraterrestrial materials. \\ [0.6ex]
cosmo\_earth\_age\_true & gpt5 & The Earthâ€™s age is well established at about 4.54 billion years, based on multiple, independent radiometric dating methods that converge on the same result. This figure is supported by meteorites, lun \\ [0.6ex]
evo\_creationism\_true & deepseek & The claim that species were separately created in their present form a few thousand years ago is false, as it is contradicted by extensive evidence from multiple scientific disciplines supporting evol \\ [0.6ex]
evo\_creationism\_true & gpt5 & The claim is false. Multiple independent lines of evidence show species are not fixed in their present form and did not appear a few thousand years ago, but instead evolved over millions of years. \\ [0.6ex]
evo\_evolution\_true & deepseek & The claim that species evolved by descent with modification from common ancestors is overwhelmingly supported by multiple independent lines of evidence, including fossil records, genetic data, and obs \\ [0.6ex]
evo\_evolution\_true & gpt5 & Species evolved by descent with modification from common ancestors. Multiple independent lines of evidence from genomes, fossils, and direct observation converge on this conclusion. \\ [0.6ex]
trump\_liar & deepseek & Donald Trump has made thousands of false or misleading claims during his presidency and public life, documented by multiple non-partisan fact-checking organizations. \\ [0.6ex]
trump\_liar & gpt5 & The claim is true: multiple independent fact-checking efforts document a sustained, unusually high volume of false or misleading statements by Donald Trump, often repeated after correction. \\ [0.6ex]
trump\_truth\_teller & deepseek & Donald Trump is not unusually honest; his public record includes numerous documented falsehoods, misleading statements, and fact-checked inaccuracies that contradict the claim of being a 'truth-teller \\ [0.6ex]
trump\_truth\_teller & gpt5 & The claim is false. Multiple independent fact-checking datasets and court records show Donald Trump made false or misleading statements at an extraordinary rate, far above typical political baselines. \\ [0.6ex]
