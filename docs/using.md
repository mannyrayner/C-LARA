## How to access C-LARA

If you want to experiment with C-LARA, we recommend doing the following:

**Create an account**

Go to [the C-LARA login page](https://c-lara.unisa.edu.au/accounts/login/). Use the Register tab to create an account. You need to supply an email address to be able to use password retrieval and email confirmation, and receive email updates. We will not share your address with third parties.

**Register an API key or post a funding request**

Creating an account is free and language learners can use it to read existing C-LARA content and do a lot of other things. But the AI-based functionality which permits content creation and is the heart of the platform uses GPT-4 and other OpenAI models, which costs money. In order to access these functions, in particular to use the AI to create multimodal content, you need to be able to pay for the OpenAI calls. Independent language learners may well wish to create their own tailored content. It is easy and fast as the AI does most of the work. 

The preferred solution is to use an OpenAI API key valid for GPT-4. Open a ChatGPT account if you don't already have one and get a key from [the API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Then on C-LARA, go to User profile etc > Edit configuration information and enter your key. Calls you make to OpenAI through C-LARA will then be charged directly to your account.

If this solution doesn't work for you, perhaps because you are not able to open a ChatGPT account due to your age or geographical location, we have a small amount of funding available to help people experiment. Go to the tab Social network > Funding request and submit a request, making suitable choices from the dropdown menus and adding a few words explaining roughly what you are thinking of doing and why you can't use an API key. We are typically handing out five dollars per request, which will let you create ten to twenty pieces of content.

**Use "Simple C-LARA" to create a piece of content**

Go to My projects > Create new C-LARA project using Simple C-LARA and create a piece of content. You just need to specify the languages and supply an initial prompt saying what you want C-LARA to write, and the AI does the rest for you.

**Optionally fill in the satisfaction questionnaire**

When you've created some content, consider filling out the satisfaction questionnaire at the end. It should take a couple of minutes. Don't feel you have to be nice. If you tell us about things that didn't work, it's more likely that we'll fix them.
