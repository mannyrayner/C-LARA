        "Ad-hoc councils of town elders slowly evolved into militias.",
        "Ad - hoc",
        "**Analysis:**\r\n\r\n- **\"Ad-hoc\"**:\r\n  - The phrase is composed of \"Ad\", \"-\", and \"hoc\". \"Ad-hoc\" is a Latin term commonly used in English to describe something created or formed for a specific purpose as necessary. It functions as an adjective and is a set expression that conveys a meaning not directly deducible from its individual components. Therefore, \"Ad-hoc\" qualifies as a Multi-Word Expression (MWE).\r\n\r\n- **\"councils of town elders\"**:\r\n  - This is a noun phrase consisting of multiple words that describe a specific group. However, it doesn't function as a single part of speech in the way MWEs do, and its meaning is directly deducible from its individual components. Thus, it does not qualify as an MWE.\r\n\r\n- **Other Phrases**:\r\n  - Phrases like \"slowly evolved\" and \"into militias\" are standard verb phrases or prepositional phrases where the meaning is directly tied to their individual words. They do not function as single lexical units beyond their component meanings and therefore are not considered MWEs."

        "In short, I disagree.",
        "In short",
        "**Analysis:**\r\n\r\n- **\"In short\"**:\r\n  - **Reasoning**: This is a set expression often used to summarize or conclude a statement, meaning \"briefly\" or \"to summarize.\" The meaning of \"in short\" is not directly deducible from the individual words \"in\" and \"short.\" Instead, it functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the entire sentence.\r\n  - **Conclusion**: It qualifies as an MWE because it forms a meaningful unit that functions as a single part of speech and its meaning isn't directly derived from its components.\r\n\r\n- **Other Possible Phrases**:\r\n  - **\"I disagree\"**:\r\n    - **Reasoning**: While it consists of two words, \"I\" (a pronoun) and \"disagree\" (a verb) combine in a straightforward manner where the meaning is directly deducible from the individual words.\r\n    - **Conclusion**: It does not qualify as an MWE since the meaning is directly inferable from its components.\r\n\r\n  - **Any other combinations** (e.g., including punctuation like \",\", \".\", etc.):\r\n    - **Reasoning**: Punctuation marks are not considered part of MWEs in this context.\r\n    - **Conclusion**: These do not qualify as MWEs."

        "Tom was going to lie, but he ended up spilling the beans.",
        "going to,ended up,spilling the beans",
        "**Analysis:**\r\n\r\n1. **\"going to lie\"**\r\n   - *\"going to\"* is part of the future construction expressing intent, functioning as an auxiliary verb phrase. Its meaning is not directly deducible from the individual words \"going\" and \"to,\" and it conveys a unique, non-compositional meaning. Therefore, it is considered an MWE.\r\n\r\n2. **\"ended up\"**\r\n   - This is an inflected form of the phrasal verb \"end up,\" which means to finally be in a particular state or situation. The meaning of \"ended up\" is not directly deducible from the individual words \"ended\" and \"up.\" It functions as a single unit of meaning within the context of the sentence, making it an MWE.\r\n\r\n3. **\"spilling the beans\"**\r\n   - This phrase is an inflected form of the idiomatic expression \"spill the beans,\" which means to reveal a secret or disclose information inadvertently. The meaning is not directly deducible from the words \"spilling,\" \"the,\" and \"beans\" taken individually. It functions as a single verb phrase with an idiomatic meaning, qualifying it as an MWE."

        "shoot the breeze",
        "**Analysis:**\r\n- **\"shoot the breeze\"** is an idiomatic expression meaning to engage in casual conversation. It functions as a single verb phrase, and its meaning is not directly deducible from the individual words. Hence, it is an MWE.\r\n- **\"for a while\"** is a prepositional phrase indicating a duration. Its meaning is directly derivable from the individual words, so it is not an MWE.\r\n- **\"talking business\"** is a standard verb-noun phrase where the meaning is compositional and directly related to its components. Therefore, it is not an MWE."
