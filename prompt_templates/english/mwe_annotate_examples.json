        "Ad - hoc",
        "**Analysis:**\r\n\r\n- **\"Ad-hoc\"**:\r\n  - The phrase is composed of \"Ad\", \"-\", and \"hoc\". \"Ad-hoc\" is a Latin term commonly used in English to describe something created or formed for a specific purpose as necessary. It functions as an adjective and is a set expression that conveys a meaning not directly deducible from its individual components. Therefore, \"Ad-hoc\" qualifies as a Multi-Word Expression (MWE).\r\n\r\n- **\"councils of town elders\"**:\r\n  - This is a noun phrase consisting of multiple words that describe a specific group. However, it doesn't function as a single part of speech in the way MWEs do, and its meaning is directly deducible from its individual components. Thus, it does not qualify as an MWE.\r\n\r\n- **Other Phrases**:\r\n  - Phrases like \"slowly evolved\" and \"into militias\" are standard verb phrases or prepositional phrases where the meaning is directly tied to their individual words. They do not function as single lexical units beyond their component meanings and therefore are not considered MWEs."

        "**Analysis:**\r\n\r\n- **\"In short\"**:\r\n  - **Reasoning**: This is a set expression often used to summarize or conclude a statement, meaning \"briefly\" or \"to summarize.\" The meaning of \"in short\" is not directly deducible from the individual words \"in\" and \"short.\" Instead, it functions as an adverbial phrase modifying the entire sentence.\r\n  - **Conclusion**: It qualifies as an MWE because it forms a meaningful unit that functions as a single part of speech and its meaning isn't directly derived from its components.\r\n\r\n- **Other Possible Phrases**:\r\n  - **\"I disagree\"**:\r\n    - **Reasoning**: While it consists of two words, \"I\" (a pronoun) and \"disagree\" (a verb) combine in a straightforward manner where the meaning is directly deducible from the individual words.\r\n    - **Conclusion**: It does not qualify as an MWE since the meaning is directly inferable from its components.\r\n\r\n  - **Any other combinations** (e.g., including punctuation like \",\", \".\", etc.):\r\n    - **Reasoning**: Punctuation marks are not considered part of MWEs in this context.\r\n    - **Conclusion**: These do not qualify as MWEs."

The meaning is not directly deducible from the words \"spilling,\" \"the,\" and \"beans\" taken individually.

        "**Analysis:**\r\n\r\n- **\"give up\"**\r\n  - *Explanation:* \"give up\" is a phrasal verb meaning to cease making an effort or to abandon something. As a phrasal verb, it functions as a single unit with a meaning that isn't directly deducible from the individual words \"give\" and \"up.\" This aligns with the definition of an MWE, functioning as a single verb and likely to appear as an entry in a comprehensive lexicon.\r\n  \r\n- **\"Never give up\"**\r\n  - *Explanation:* While \"never give up\" is a commonly used imperative phrase encouraging persistence, the MWE definition emphasizes that the expression should function as a single part of speech with a non-compositional meaning. In this case, \"never\" modifies the phrasal verb \"give up\" but doesn't form a new semantic unit on its own. Therefore, \"Never give up\" is not considered an MWE under the provided definition.\r\n\r\n- **Other Parts (\"Never\", \"hope\")**\r\n  - *Explanation:* \"Never\" is an adverb modifying the verb phrase \"give up,\" and \"hope\" is a noun object of the verb.

The meaning of \"traffic light\" is not directly deducible from the individual words \"traffic\" and \"light\" when used separately.
