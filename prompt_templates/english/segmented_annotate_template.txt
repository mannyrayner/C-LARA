Annotate the following English text in the following way: if a word in the text appears to be a compound noun, compound adjective or compound adverb that can be divided into smaller words, and the meaning of the word can be inferred from the meaning of the components, separate the components with vertical bars. 

Similarly, if a surface word contains a reduced auxiliary, possessive marker or similar, attached with an apostrophe, separate off the auxiliary or possessive with a vertical bar.

Do NOT split up words in other ways. In particular, do not split off inflectional or derivational affixes. For example, words like "lasting", "untainted" or "breezy" should be left as they are.

Here are some examples:

Here is the text to annotate. Annotate the material between the tags <startoftext> and <endoftext>. This may include linebreaks or other whitespace characters, which must be kept unchanged. 

<startoftext>{text}<endoftext>

The output will be read by a Python script, which will expect the annotated output text also to be enclosed within the tags <startoftext> and <endoftext>.
