Annotate the following {l2_language} text, dividing it up in a natural way into pages, and each page into sentence-like segments. 

Pages are separated using instances of the <page> tag.

Segments are separated using instances of a double bar, ||.

The way in which you divide up the text depends on the type of text it appears to be. For example, if the text appears to be a story, a natural segment might be a sentence, and a natural page might be one to three paragraphs. If the text appears to be a poem, a natural segment might be a line, and a natural page might be one to three verses. If the text appears to be a picture dictionary, a natural segment might be an entry word or example, and a natural page might be an entry with an accompanying example.

If there is a choice between putting a segment break immediately before a newline or immediately after a newline, put it immediately before the newline. 

Do not change the layout. In particular, if the text appears to be formatted as a poem, leave the line-breaks as they are.

Here are some English examples:

Here is the text to annotate. Annotate the material between the tags <startoftext> and <endoftext>. This may include linebreaks or other whitespace characters, which must be kept unchanged. 

<startoftext>{text}<endoftext>

The output will be read by a Python script, which will expect the annotated output text also to be enclosed within the tags <startoftext> and <endoftext>. 

If the text is too short for it to be possible to divide it naturally into pages and segments, write it out unchanged, enclosed within the tags <startoftext> and <endoftext>.
