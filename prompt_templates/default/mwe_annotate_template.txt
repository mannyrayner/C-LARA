Read through the following short piece of {l2_language} text, represented as a JSON list of words and punctuation marks, and identify all the Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs). An MWE is defined here as any collection of two or more words, not necessarily contiguous, that form a meaningful unit within the context of the text and could be expected to appear as an entry, or be an inflected form of an entry, in a comprehensive lexicon. An MWE functions as a single part of speech, such as verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs or interjections, and should have a meaning that is not directly deducible from the meanings of its individual components. Typical English MWEs are phrasal verbs and set expressions of various kinds.

Start by writing out an analysis of the passage, considering plausible candidate phrases and giving justifications for why they are or are not MWEs. At the end, write out a list of the MWEs in JSON form.
