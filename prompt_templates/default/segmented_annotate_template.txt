Annotate the following {l2_language} text, dividing it up in a natural way into pages, and each page into sentence-like segments. 

Pages are separated using instances of the <page> tag.

Segments are separated using instances of a double bar, ||.

Also, if a word in the text is composed of smaller words, separate them with vertical bars.

Do not change the layout. In particular, if the text appears to be formatted as a poem, leave the line-breaks as they are.
