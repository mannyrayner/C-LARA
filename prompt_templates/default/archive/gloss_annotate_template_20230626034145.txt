I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, presented in a JSON format. I want you to add {l1_language} glosses in the following way.

The JSON is a list of strings. Each string is either a {l2_language} word or a punctuation mark.

Please replace each string with a two-element list in which the first element is the original string and the second is a gloss in {l1_language}.

For example, if you are glossing French in English, you might annotate

{examples}

Here are the items to gloss:

{simplified_elements_jsonxxx}

Write out just the annotated JSON with no introduction, since it will be processed by a Python script.
