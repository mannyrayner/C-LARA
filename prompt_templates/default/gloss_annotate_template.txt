I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, presented in a JSON format. I want you to add {l1_language} glosses in the following way.

The JSON is a list of strings. Each string is either a {l2_language} word or a punctuation mark.

Please replace each string with a two-element list in which the first element is the original string and the second is a gloss in {l1_language}. If the string appears to be a proper name, and you cannot find a known form of the proper name in {l1_language}, gloss the proper name as itself or a transliteration of itself.  If there is no sensible way to gloss the string in {l1_language}, gloss it as '-'. Also, if two words form a single lexical unit, gloss each word with the whole unit.

For example, if you are glossing French in English, English in French or English in Chinese, you might annotate

{examples}

Here are the items to gloss:

{simplified_elements_json}

{context_text}

Write out just the annotated JSON with no introduction, since it will be processed by a Python script.
