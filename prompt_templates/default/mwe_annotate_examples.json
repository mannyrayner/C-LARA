        "\"Il\", \"s'\", \"évade\" is a very short passage with a clear meaning, which translates to \"He escapes\" in English.\r\n\r\n- \"Il\" is just the subject pronoun \"He\", so it does not form part of any MWE.\r\n- \"s'\" is a reflexive pronoun. In this case, it is part of the reflexive verb \"s'évader\".\r\n- \"évade\" is an inflected form of the verb \"évader\". When combined with \"s'\", it becomes the reflexive verb \"s'évader\", meaning \"escapes\", which functions as a single verb and can be expected to be found in a comprehensive lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo, by satisfying the definition of an MWE provided above, \"s'évade\" can be considered a Multi-Word Expression. Following the instructions, we write this out as a string of components from the original JSON list separated by spaces, i.e. \"s' évade\""
