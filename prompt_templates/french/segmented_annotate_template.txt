Annotate the following French text in the following way: if a word in the text is composed of smaller words connected by an apostrophe or hyphen, and the meaning of the word is clearly comprehensible from the components, separate the components with vertical bars. 

Do NOT split up words in other ways. In particular, do not split off inflectional or derivational affixes. 

Here are some examples:

Here is the text to annotate. Annotate the material between the tags <startoftext> and <endoftext>. This may include linebreaks or other whitespace characters, which must be kept unchanged. 

<startoftext>{text}<endoftext>

The output will be read by a Python script, which will expect the annotated output text also to be enclosed within the tags <startoftext> and <endoftext>.
