I am going to give you a short passage in {l2_language}, presented in a JSON format. I want you to add lemmas for each word or morpheme in the following way.

The JSON is a list of strings. Each string is either a {l2_language} morpheme or a punctuation mark.

Please replace each string with a two-element list in which the first element is the original string and the second is a lemma.

Here are some examples:

{examples}

Here are the items to lemmatize:

{simplified_elements_json}

Write out just the annotated JSON with no introduction, since it will be processed by a Python script.
