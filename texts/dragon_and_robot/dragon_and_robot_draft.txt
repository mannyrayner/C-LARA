My name is Li Mei, and I am now a very old woman.
This morning, my granddaughter asked me:
“Grandma, what was the most important thing you ever built?”

She expected me to say a bridge or a school. Instead, I laughed.
“The most important thing I ever built,” I told her, “was a spaceship. Or perhaps I should say — half of a spaceship.”

She looked at me with big eyes. “Grandma, you built a spaceship?”

“Yes,” I said. “A very unusual spaceship. One half was shaped like a dragon, long and shining, with wings of fire. The other half was a cube, simple and heavy, like a box of stone. The cube came from the West. The dragon came from China. And we, the students of both East and West, had to learn how to put them together.”

I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes. The memories came back to me as if they had happened only yesterday: the crowded design hall, the smell of instant noodles at midnight, the sound of pens scratching across endless paper forms.

“Did you fly it, Grandma?” my grandson asked.

“No,” I said with a smile. “I only filled out forms. Form 1A, Form 1B, Form 22Z, and finally—Form 88Q: Application to Apply for Permission to Redesign the Application Form. I think we filled that one out six times.”

They all laughed. I laughed too, though at the time it had not been so funny.

“And what about love, Grandma?” asked my granddaughter. “Was there a boy?”

I sighed. “Yes. There was a boy. His name was David. He was clever and kind, but he was also stubborn. He believed in cubes, not dragons. We worked side by side for months, and sometimes I thought… perhaps. But in the end—” I shook my head. “In the end, our hearts could not fly together.”

The children grew quiet. I decided not to tell them everything, not yet. The quarrels, the politics, the ridiculous leader with orange hair who kept shouting, ‘Nobody builds spaceships better than us!’ All of that could wait.

Instead, I poured tea and said, “Let me begin at the beginning. The year was 2041. The Interstellar Design Challenge had just been announced. We were young, full of ideas, and we had no idea how many forms we would need to fill out.”

Chapter 1: Arrival at the Base

I was twenty years old when I first arrived at the International Design Base. It stood on the edge of the desert, half in China, half in the West, as if even the buildings could not decide which side they belonged to.

The Chinese side was neat and green. There were trees, gardens, and clear signs with red characters. The Western side was noisy, full of glass towers, advertising screens, and food stalls selling hot dogs and hamburgers. A great metal wall ran through the middle, but there were many doors, and people crossed back and forth all day.

I carried one small suitcase and a folder of documents. To enter the base, I had to show my passport, my student card, and my Form 1A: Permission to Join the Project.

The guard, an alien with three eyes and a tired voice, stamped my paper and said, “Next!”

Inside, I found the hall full of students. Some wore red scarves with dragons on them. Others wore blue jackets with cubes. The two groups stood apart, shouting about whose design was better.

At the front of the hall stood a tall girl with blond hair and a serious face.
“I am Anna Müller,” she said in English. “I am the project manager. I hope we can work together. But first—” she held up a heavy book—“you must all fill out these forms.”

A groan went through the hall. The book was as thick as a dictionary.

I found a seat next to a boy with brown hair and a pencil stuck behind his ear. He was drawing a square box in his notebook. I looked over his shoulder and said, “That is very boring.”

He looked up, surprised. His eyes were blue and full of humour.
“It is not boring,” he said. “It is safe. A cube is the most stable shape in the universe.”

“A dragon is stronger,” I replied. “It can fly, turn, and inspire.”

He smiled. “Perhaps. But cubes do not catch fire.”

We stared at each other for a moment, half amused, half annoyed. Then he held out his hand.
“My name is David,” he said.
“Li Mei,” I replied.

That was the beginning.

At this point, I must pause in my story. My grandchildren are staring at me with wide eyes. They do not know the world as it was in 2041. So I tell them.

“The Interstellar Design Challenge,” I explain, “was not really about spaceships at all. It was about pride.”

Both East and West wanted to impress the aliens of the Galactic Council, who had just made contact with Earth. The Council did not care what our ships looked like, or even if they flew well. They only wanted to see that we could work together. But of course, that was the hardest part of all.

The Chinese government promised to show the wisdom of ancient tradition. The Western governments promised to show the power of modern technology. Each side sent its best young students to the desert base, and each side expected victory.

And then there was the problem of money. Always money! The budget was too small, and every new form seemed to shrink it more. We filled out requests for pencils, for pens, even for toilet paper. Each request needed three signatures and two stamps.

My grandson laughs. “Grandma, did they really make you ask permission for toilet paper?”

“Yes,” I say. “And sometimes the answer was no.”

I shake my head. “But still, we believed in our dream. We wanted to touch the stars. And so we worked, we argued, we filled out forms, and we tried not to think too much about politics.”

I do not yet tell them about Mr. Gold, or the cameras, or how he made everything more difficult. That part of the story is still to come.

Chapter 2: The Mountain of Forms

At first, the forms were simple. Form 1A: Permission to Join the Project.
We all filled it out in neat handwriting. We signed our names, stapled the pages, and handed them to Anna Müller. She stamped them quickly and nodded.

But then came Form 2B: Permission to Begin Drawing a Design.
And Form 3C: Application to Request Materials.
And Form 4D: Application to Correct Mistakes Made on Previous Forms.

By the end of the first week, our desks were buried in paper. Students joked that the only thing we were really building was a giant paper spaceship.

Zhang Wei, my best friend, held up a form one evening and said, “This one asks me to describe how many pens I will need to describe how many pens I will need. I think the forms are writing themselves.”

We all laughed, but it was tired laughter. None of us had slept much.

The First Visit from Mr. Gold

One hot afternoon, when we were struggling with Form 12H: Application to Use Electricity for Non-Essential Purposes, the doors of the hall burst open.

A man strode in, followed by a crowd of cameras and reporters. His hair was a strange shade of orange. His smile was wide and fixed, as if it had been painted on. He wore a suit too shiny for the desert sun.

“Ladies and gentlemen, students of the world!” he shouted. “I am Mr. Gold, and I am here to make sure this project is a success. A great success. Maybe the greatest success in history!”

We looked at each other. Nobody had invited him.

He walked between the rows of tables, slapping shoulders and pointing at designs.
“The dragon? Beautiful! But maybe give it my face. The cube? Fantastic! But maybe make it a little more cube-shaped. Nobody does cubes better than me.”

Anna Müller tried to stop him. “Sir, we are in the middle of an official process—”

Mr. Gold waved her away. “Process? Forget process. Cameras love me. Aliens will love me. You’re going to win big. Huge!”

Then he pulled a thick gold marker from his pocket and wrote his name across the whiteboard in enormous letters: GOLD.

When he finally left, taking the cameras with him, the hall was silent. Then Zhang Wei said, “Maybe we need another form. Form 13I: Permission to Ignore Important Visitors.”

This time, we laughed harder. But some of us, I think, also felt a little afraid.

When I think back on those early days, it is hard to separate the forms, the man called Mr. Gold, and the boy named David. They are all tied together in my memory, like pages that stuck together in the same book.

Mr. Gold was not really part of the project, of course. He was a politician, a businessman, or perhaps just a performer who loved the sound of his own voice. Even then, many people laughed at him. But he had power, and he used it like a hammer. One word from him, and our budget was cut. Another word, and we were forced to repaint the cube ship in his favourite colour — bright gold, of course.

He was noisy, impossible to ignore.
David was the opposite. Quiet, careful, always holding his pencil like it was a shield. He did not like Mr. Gold, but he did not fight him either. He preferred to work late at night, when the cameras were gone. That was when we talked the most.

Sometimes our conversations were about engineering. Sometimes they were about life. I told him about dragons in Chinese stories, symbols of power and hope. He told me about the London Underground, about trains that sometimes arrived on time, sometimes not. I laughed at that. He laughed when I told him I wanted our dragon ship to breathe fire.

And sometimes, in those quiet nights, I thought perhaps there was something more between us. But then I remembered his cube, and he remembered my dragon, and the forms kept piling higher, and Mr. Gold kept writing his name in letters taller than the door.

So you see, children, it was not just bureaucracy or politics or love. It was all three together, tangled in a knot. And knots are not easy to untie.

When I think of that time, children, I do not remember the days in order. They come back to me like pieces of paper flying in the wind — some stamped with approval, some torn, some lost.

One page has Mr. Gold in the middle, his mouth wide, shouting promises. Another page has David, bent over his drawings, too serious for a boy of twenty. Another page has me, my hands cramped from writing the same word a hundred times on a form. Sometimes the pages stick together. I cannot always tell which came first.

“Grandma,” says my granddaughter, “stories are supposed to go in order. First this happened, then that happened. Otherwise it’s confusing.”

I laugh. “You are right, little one. But life does not come in order when you are old. Still, I will try.”

The Paper Mountain

At the start, we believed the forms would end. We told ourselves: Fill out ten, and then the real work will begin. But after ten came twenty, after twenty came fifty. Each new form asked us to confirm the last form, or explain why the last form had been written in blue ink instead of black.

Zhang Wei made a tower of empty noodle cups, taller than his head, and placed the latest forms on top like a flag. “Here,” he said, “is the first human settlement on Mars.” We laughed so hard the tower collapsed.

That was when I realised the forms were not only an obstacle. They were a test. The Galactic Council wanted to see if we could endure nonsense together. And perhaps they were right. If you can survive Form 22Z, you can survive anything.

Mr. Gold Again

And of course, there was Mr. Gold. He came back almost every week. Sometimes he brought cameras. Sometimes he brought hamburgers. Once he brought a gold-plated toilet and announced it was “a symbol of progress.”

“Grandma!” cries my grandson. “A gold toilet? Really?”

“Yes,” I say. “It shone so brightly in the desert sun that no one could use it. But the cameras loved it, and Mr. Gold loved the cameras. And while everyone was laughing, our budget was cut again.”

David was not laughing. He sat at his desk, his cube design half-finished, and muttered, “This is a circus.” I wanted to comfort him, but I did not know how. Instead, I picked up another form and began to write.

A Memory of David

Do you see how the pages stick together, children? I try to speak of Mr. Gold, but David is there as well. He is always there.

One night he offered me half his sandwich. “You cannot live on noodles alone,” he said. I teased him — “British food is worse than no food.” He smiled, but his eyes were tired. I think that was the first night I wondered if admiration could become something more.

But I should not say too much about that yet. Not yet.

Late at night, the base was quiet. The glass towers of the Western side went dark, the gardens of the Chinese side grew still, and only the sound of crickets filled the air. That was when David and I often stayed behind in the hall.

We worked side by side, our desks covered with forms, rulers, and cups of cold tea. I would sketch the curve of a dragon’s wing, he would draw the straight line of a cube’s edge. Sometimes our pencils touched on the same page, and we would laugh, embarrassed, as if the paper had caught us holding hands.

I remember one night especially. I had been scolded that morning by Anna Müller for using the wrong colour ink on Form 15K. My spirits were low. David noticed and said, quietly, “Don’t let them crush you, Li Mei. The forms are not the real work. The real work is in here.” He tapped his head, then his heart.

“Grandma,” my granddaughter interrupts, “did you fall in love right then?”

I shake my head. “Not love. Not yet. But something dangerous began to grow in me that night. Something that made me think cubes and dragons might not be so far apart after all.”

The next day, of course, Mr. Gold returned. He never came at night, only in the bright hours when the cameras could see him clearly. This time he arrived with a marching band. They played a song I can still hear in my nightmares: ‘Make Space Great Again!’

He ordered us all to wave little flags while he gave a speech. “This will be the greatest spaceship in history. Bigger than the pyramids, faster than light, and painted gold from nose to tail!”

We waved the flags, because the cameras were watching. Then, when he left, we dropped them in the trash.

You see, children, how strange it was? Bureaucracy on one side, Mr. Gold on the other, and in between, a boy with blue eyes offering me half a sandwich. I cannot separate them in my memory. They belong to the same page, stuck together forever.

By the end of the second month, our hands were stained with ink. Some students began to dream of forms in their sleep. One boy from Canada woke screaming one night: “Where is my signature? Where is my stamp?”

Zhang Wei suggested we invent a robot to sign forms for us. David laughed and drew a small cube with a mechanical hand, writing David Harris in neat letters. I added wings and fire to the sketch. Soon the whole team was crowded around, laughing until tears came. It was the happiest I ever saw us.

But then Anna Müller entered the hall and said, “Why are you wasting time? Form 32L is overdue.” The laughter died at once.

Not all of us obeyed the rules. One evening Zhang Wei filled in Form 27F: Request for Additional Chairs with pure nonsense — he wrote the names of every dragon in Chinese mythology. He handed it in with a straight face.

Three weeks later the form came back approved, with a stamp that said VALID. We received twenty chairs. Each had the name of a dragon painted on the back: Yinglong, Shenlong, Fucanglong.

“See?” Zhang Wei said. “Bureaucracy may be blind, but dragons can still win.”

That night I found David sitting alone, one of the dragon chairs pulled up to his desk. He was staring at his cube design, frowning. I asked what was wrong.

He shook his head. “Sometimes I think the forms are easier than the people. At least the forms don’t argue back.”

I wanted to tell him he was wrong, that people were worth more than paper. But the words would not come. Instead, I sat down beside him. We worked in silence, two shadows bent over two impossible dreams.

“So Grandma,” my grandson says, “were you happy then?”

I think for a long moment. “Happy? Perhaps. But it was a strange kind of happiness, built out of paper towers and golden toilets, half real and half absurd. And at the centre of it all was David, and I never knew whether to laugh with him or to argue with him. Perhaps both.”

Chapter 3: Dreams and Disruptions

When I close my eyes, I can still see it: the great hall covered in blueprints. On one side, sheets of paper filled with perfect squares and straight lines. On the other, wild curves, wings, and flames. Cubes and dragons, side by side, like two different languages written on the same wall.

It was beautiful, children, though at the time it felt like war.

David stood before his cube, explaining in slow English how each side gave balance, how the structure would hold firm even in the storms of space. He spoke like an engineer, precise and careful, never raising his voice.

I stood before my dragon, describing how it would twist, turn, and soar. “The cube is strong,” I said, “but the dragon is alive. It will inspire Earth and impress the Council.” My words ran fast, my hands moved faster, sketching arcs in the air.

The students cheered — half for him, half for me. The room was divided.

“Grandma,” my granddaughter interrupts, “which one was better?”

I smile. “Ah, my dear, that is the wrong question. The cube was safer. The dragon was stronger. And both were incomplete. We were too young to see that then.”

Of course, Mr. Gold could not resist. He appeared with cameras just as the arguments were reaching their peak.

“Listen, folks,” he said, patting David’s cube. “This is great. Very great. But maybe make it bigger. Much bigger. Nobody loves a small cube. And the dragon—oh, the dragon is terrific! Maybe add some gold teeth. Aliens love gold teeth. Believe me.”

We groaned in silence while the cameras flashed.

Now, as I tell you this, I cannot decide whether to laugh or cry. The truth is, we were proud of our dreams, even when they clashed. And we were afraid too — afraid of failure, of Mr. Gold’s speeches, of each other.

And somewhere in that mixture, I began to care too much about a boy with blue eyes and a stubborn pencil.

As the designs grew, so did the paperwork. Every new line on a blueprint required a new form.

Form 41M: Application to Add a Wing.

Form 41N: Application to Remove a Wing.

Form 42A: Application to Explain Why You Added and Then Removed the Wing.

One poor student from Italy spent an entire week arguing with an alien bureaucrat about the difference between “delete” and “erase.” In the end, he was told to fill in both forms.

Zhang Wei kept a scoreboard on the wall: Forms Completed: 327. Actual Progress on Spaceship: 0.

Then came the day of the “Great Announcement.” Mr. Gold called all of us to the courtyard. A stage had been built overnight, covered in gold cloth. Reporters shouted questions, cameras buzzed like flies.

Mr. Gold climbed the stage, raised his hands, and shouted, “Today we take the project to the next level! I have spoken with the Council. They agree with me — the ship must have a golf course. A very big golf course. The biggest in the galaxy!”

The students gasped. Anna Müller dropped her clipboard. David whispered, “He’s joking.”

But he was not. Within hours, we received a new form: Form 50G: Application to Install Recreational Facilities on Interstellar Vehicles.

“Grandma!” my grandson bursts out, “a golf course in space? That’s ridiculous!”

“Yes,” I say, “ridiculous. But you must remember, children, bureaucracy feeds on the ridiculous. Once the form existed, we had no choice but to fill it out.”

And yet — between the endless forms and Mr. Gold’s speeches, there were moments of light. Laughter at Zhang Wei’s scoreboard. Shared groans when we heard the words new regulation. Even a kind of strange unity, East and West together against the absurd.

But for me, there was always David. His cube stood silent, his pencil moved slowly, and in the middle of the circus, he was the only thing that felt steady.

That night the base was restless. The Western students argued angrily about the size of the golf course. The Chinese students laughed until they cried. Anna Müller sat in her office, filling out Form 50G with tight, furious handwriting.

I slipped into the hall, hoping to find quiet. David was already there, sitting at his desk under a single lamp. His cube design lay before him, covered in careful lines and numbers. He did not look up as I entered.

“You heard the announcement?” I asked.

“Yes,” he said. His voice was tired. “A golf course. On a spaceship. What next? A swimming pool for dolphins?”

I laughed softly. “Don’t say it too loudly. They will make us fill in the form tomorrow.”

At last he looked at me. His face was serious, but there was a shadow of a smile. He pushed his papers aside and said, “Sometimes I think the whole project is a joke.”

“Then why do you stay?” I asked.

He tapped his pencil on the desk. “Because cubes don’t give up. They stay where they are.”

I sat beside him, laying out my sketches of wings and fire. “And dragons don’t give up either. They fly until their last breath.”

For a moment we sat in silence, cube and dragon side by side on the same table. The light from the lamp made his hair shine, and I thought: perhaps this boy is steadier than any cube.

“Grandma,” my granddaughter whispers, “did you love him then?”

I close my eyes. “Love? Perhaps it was the beginning. But beginnings are easy. It is the endings that are hard.”

Looking back now, children, I see it clearly: the laughter at the golf course, the late-night silence with David, the smell of paper and ink. They are bound together in my memory. I cannot tell you which came first. Perhaps it does not matter.

What I know is that the dragon and the cube were no longer just designs. They were symbols — of our pride, our stubbornness, and maybe even of the feelings I was too young to name.

The next weeks were harder. The dragon grew longer, its wings spreading across the drafting tables. The cube grew taller, its sides marked with precise numbers. Both designs were beautiful in their way, but they pulled us further apart.

The dragon team shouted that the cube was lifeless, a stone with no spirit. The cube team argued that the dragon was dangerous, a firework waiting to explode. Each side filled out forms accusing the other of wasting resources.

One morning we received Form 61X: Application to Resolve Disputes Between Design Factions. We filled it out three times. The aliens stamped each version PENDING. Nothing changed.

And through it all, Mr. Gold kept returning. One week he demanded a gold swimming pool. The next, a giant portrait of himself painted on the dragon’s wings. He clapped his hands, smiled at the cameras, and left the engineers to argue in silence.

At night, I still worked beside David. We spoke less now, but the quiet between us felt heavy, as if words had been replaced by something unspoken. Sometimes I wanted to ask him if he saw me as more than a rival. Sometimes I wanted to tear his cube in two.

“Grandma,” says my grandson, “why didn’t you just tell him how you felt?”

I smile sadly. “Because, child, we were too young, and too proud. And perhaps the forms had already taught us to write answers on paper, not in our hearts.”

So you see, children, Chapter Three of my story is not only about dreams. It is also about disruptions — about gold toilets and golf courses, about cubes and dragons, and about a girl and a boy who stood too close together while the world pulled them apart.

The real rupture had not yet come. But we were already standing on the fault line.

Chapter 4: The Rift

The day came when the Council sent its message: Only one design may continue.

Those words spread through the base like fire. Half the students cheered, certain the dragon would win. Half stood taller, sure the cube was the future. And in the middle I saw David, his jaw tight, his pencil snapping in two.

Anna Müller read the message aloud in her calm German voice. “The Council requires a unified project. We must decide.” Then she handed out a new document: Form 88Q: Application to Apply for Permission to Redesign the Application Form.

The hall went silent. Some students laughed, some groaned. I felt tears prick my eyes. It was too much — the forms, the speeches, the endless division. Even the joke was no longer funny.

The dragon team shouted: “The cube cannot turn! It will drift like a rock in the river!”
The cube team shouted back: “The dragon will burn! It is a firework, not a ship!”

I shouted too. David shouted too. Our voices rose above the others, sharp as knives. He said I was reckless. I said he was cowardly. He said cubes were strong. I said dragons had spirit. We were no longer laughing.

That was the first time I saw anger in his eyes.

“Grandma,” my grandson whispers, “but you liked him. Why did you fight?”

I sigh. “Because liking someone does not erase the distance between you. And pride can be heavier than love. Especially when you are twenty years old.”

Mr. Gold’s Triumph

Into this chaos walked Mr. Gold. Cameras followed him like loyal dogs. He spread his arms and shouted, “Both designs are terrific! Really terrific! But cubes are tremendous, the best. Dragons are good too — very good, maybe the best dragons in history — but the cube will win, believe me!”

The cube team roared with joy. The dragon team hissed with fury. Mr. Gold waved and climbed onto the half-built cube, declaring, “This will be my ship! A golden ship for a golden future!”

And the cameras flashed, and the headlines the next morning all said the same: Gold Backs the Cube.

Children, I have wondered all my life if I should have stayed silent that day. If I should have spoken softer, or reached for David’s hand instead of pointing my finger. But history is not built from maybes. It is built from words spoken too quickly, from forms signed too late, from choices made in anger.

That day, the rift opened. And once a rift opens, it does not close easily.
