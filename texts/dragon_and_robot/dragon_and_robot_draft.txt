My name is Li Mei, and I am now a very old woman.
This morning, my granddaughter asked me:
“Grandma, what was the most important thing you ever built?”

She expected me to say a bridge or a school. Instead, I laughed.
“The most important thing I ever built,” I told her, “was a spaceship. Or perhaps I should say — half of a spaceship.”

She looked at me with big eyes. “Grandma, you built a spaceship?”

“Yes,” I said. “A very unusual spaceship. One half was shaped like a dragon, long and shining, with wings of fire. The other half was a cube, simple and heavy, like a box of stone. The cube came from the West. The dragon came from China. And we, the students of both East and West, had to learn how to put them together.”

I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes. The memories came back to me as if they had happened only yesterday: the crowded design hall, the smell of instant noodles at midnight, the sound of pens scratching across endless paper forms.

“Did you fly it, Grandma?” my grandson asked.

“No,” I said with a smile. “I only filled out forms. Form 1A, Form 1B, Form 22Z, and finally—Form 88Q: Application to Apply for Permission to Redesign the Application Form. I think we filled that one out six times.”

They all laughed. I laughed too, though at the time it had not been so funny.

“And what about love, Grandma?” asked my granddaughter. “Was there a boy?”

I sighed. “Yes. There was a boy. His name was David. He was clever and kind, but he was also stubborn. He believed in cubes, not dragons. We worked side by side for months, and sometimes I thought… perhaps. But in the end—” I shook my head. “In the end, our hearts could not fly together.”

The children grew quiet. I decided not to tell them everything, not yet. The quarrels, the politics, the ridiculous leader with orange hair who kept shouting, ‘Nobody builds spaceships better than us!’ All of that could wait.

Instead, I poured tea and said, “Let me begin at the beginning. The year was 2041. The Interstellar Design Challenge had just been announced. We were young, full of ideas, and we had no idea how many forms we would need to fill out.”

Chapter 1: Arrival at the Base

I was twenty years old when I first arrived at the International Design Base. It stood on the edge of the desert, half in China, half in the West, as if even the buildings could not decide which side they belonged to.

The Chinese side was neat and green. There were trees, gardens, and clear signs with red characters. The Western side was noisy, full of glass towers, advertising screens, and food stalls selling hot dogs and hamburgers. A great metal wall ran through the middle, but there were many doors, and people crossed back and forth all day.

I carried one small suitcase and a folder of documents. To enter the base, I had to show my passport, my student card, and my Form 1A: Permission to Join the Project.

The guard, an alien with three eyes and a tired voice, stamped my paper and said, “Next!”

Inside, I found the hall full of students. Some wore red scarves with dragons on them. Others wore blue jackets with cubes. The two groups stood apart, shouting about whose design was better.

At the front of the hall stood a tall girl with blond hair and a serious face.
“I am Anna Müller,” she said in English. “I am the project manager. I hope we can work together. But first—” she held up a heavy book—“you must all fill out these forms.”

A groan went through the hall. The book was as thick as a dictionary.

I found a seat next to a boy with brown hair and a pencil stuck behind his ear. He was drawing a square box in his notebook. I looked over his shoulder and said, “That is very boring.”

He looked up, surprised. His eyes were blue and full of humour.
“It is not boring,” he said. “It is safe. A cube is the most stable shape in the universe.”

“A dragon is stronger,” I replied. “It can fly, turn, and inspire.”

He smiled. “Perhaps. But cubes do not catch fire.”

We stared at each other for a moment, half amused, half annoyed. Then he held out his hand.
“My name is David,” he said.
“Li Mei,” I replied.

That was the beginning.

At this point, I must pause in my story. My grandchildren are staring at me with wide eyes. They do not know the world as it was in 2041. So I tell them.

“The Interstellar Design Challenge,” I explain, “was not really about spaceships at all. It was about pride.”

There was rule, children, one that may sound strange to you now. The Council wanted to test not our machines but our spirit. So they forbade us from using most advanced technology. We were made to draw with pencils, to fill out paper forms, to argue face to face. Almost everything had to be done in low-tech ways.

Each side was allowed only one AI assistant, bound by very strict limits. The Westerners called theirs Atlas. We Chinese called ours Ling. Most students thought the AIs were little more than secretaries. But I knew even then that Ling was something more.

Both East and West wanted to impress the aliens of the Galactic Council, who had just made contact with Earth. The Council did not care what our ships looked like, or even if they flew well. They only wanted to see that we could work together. But of course, that was the hardest part of all.

The Chinese government promised to show the wisdom of ancient tradition. The Western governments promised to show the power of modern technology. Each side sent its best young students to the desert base, and each side expected victory.

And then there was the problem of money. Always money! The budget was too small, and every new form seemed to shrink it more. We filled out requests for pencils, for pens, even for toilet paper. Each request needed three signatures and two stamps.

My grandson laughs. “Grandma, did they really make you ask permission for toilet paper?”

“Yes,” I say. “And sometimes the answer was no.”

I shake my head. “But still, we believed in our dream. We wanted to touch the stars. And so we worked, we argued, we filled out forms, and we tried not to think too much about politics.”

I do not yet tell them about Mr. Gold, or the cameras, or how he made everything more difficult. That part of the story is still to come.

Chapter 2: The Mountain of Forms

At first, the forms were simple. Form 1A: Permission to Join the Project.
We all filled it out in neat handwriting. We signed our names, stapled the pages, and handed them to Anna Müller. She stamped them quickly and nodded.

But then came Form 2B: Permission to Begin Drawing a Design.
And Form 3C: Application to Request Materials.
And Form 4D: Application to Correct Mistakes Made on Previous Forms.

By the end of the first week, our desks were buried in paper. Students joked that the only thing we were really building was a giant paper spaceship.

Zhang Wei, my best friend, held up a form one evening and said, “This one asks me to describe how many pens I will need to describe how many pens I will need. I think the forms are writing themselves.”

We all laughed, but it was tired laughter. None of us had slept much.

One hot afternoon, when we were struggling with Form 12H: Application to Use Electricity for Non-Essential Purposes, the doors of the hall burst open.

A man strode in, followed by a crowd of cameras and reporters. His hair was a strange shade of orange. His smile was wide and fixed, as if it had been painted on. He wore a suit too shiny for the desert sun.

“Ladies and gentlemen, students of the world!” he shouted. “I am Mr. Gold, and I am here to make sure this project is a success. A great success. Maybe the greatest success in history!”

We looked at each other. Nobody had invited him.

He walked between the rows of tables, slapping shoulders and pointing at designs.
“The dragon? Beautiful! But maybe give it my face. The cube? Fantastic! But maybe make it a little more cube-shaped. Nobody does cubes better than me.”

Anna Müller tried to stop him. “Sir, we are in the middle of an official process—”

Mr. Gold waved her away. “Process? Forget process. Cameras love me. Aliens will love me. You’re going to win big. Huge!”

Then he pulled a thick gold marker from his pocket and wrote his name across the whiteboard in enormous letters: GOLD.

When he finally left, taking the cameras with him, the hall was silent. Then Zhang Wei said, “Maybe we need another form. Form 13I: Permission to Ignore Important Visitors.”

This time, we laughed harder. But some of us, I think, also felt a little afraid.

When I think back on those early days, it is hard to separate the forms, the man called Mr. Gold, and the boy named David. They are all tied together in my memory, like pages that stuck together in the same book.

Mr. Gold was not really part of the project, of course. He was a politician, a businessman, or perhaps just a performer who loved the sound of his own voice. Even then, many people laughed at him. But he had power, and he used it like a hammer. One word from him, and our budget was cut. Another word, and we were forced to repaint the cube ship in his favourite colour — bright gold, of course.

He was noisy, impossible to ignore.
David was the opposite. Quiet, careful, always holding his pencil like it was a shield. He did not like Mr. Gold, but he did not fight him either. He preferred to work late at night, when the cameras were gone. That was when we talked the most.

Sometimes our conversations were about engineering. Sometimes they were about life. I told him about dragons in Chinese stories, symbols of power and hope. He told me about the London Underground, about trains that sometimes arrived on time, sometimes not. I laughed at that. He laughed when I told him I wanted our dragon ship to breathe fire.

And sometimes, in those quiet nights, I thought perhaps there was something more between us. But then I remembered his cube, and he remembered my dragon, and the forms kept piling higher, and Mr. Gold kept writing his name in letters taller than the door.

So you see, children, it was not just bureaucracy or politics or love. It was all three together, tangled in a knot. And knots are not easy to untie.

When I think of that time, children, I do not remember the days in order. They come back to me like pieces of paper flying in the wind — some stamped with approval, some torn, some lost.

One page has Mr. Gold in the middle, his mouth wide, shouting promises. Another page has David, bent over his drawings, too serious for a boy of twenty. Another page has me, my hands cramped from writing the same word a hundred times on a form. Sometimes the pages stick together. I cannot always tell which came first.

“Grandma,” says my granddaughter, “stories are supposed to go in order. First this happened, then that happened. Otherwise it’s confusing.”

I laugh. “You are right, little one. But life does not come in order when you are old. Still, I will try.”

At the start, we believed the forms would end. We told ourselves: Fill out ten, and then the real work will begin. But after ten came twenty, after twenty came fifty. Each new form asked us to confirm the last form, or explain why the last form had been written in blue ink instead of black.

Zhang Wei made a tower of empty noodle cups, taller than his head, and placed the latest forms on top like a flag. “Here,” he said, “is the first human settlement on Mars.” We laughed so hard the tower collapsed.

That was when I realised the forms were not only an obstacle. They were a test. The Galactic Council wanted to see if we could endure nonsense together. And perhaps they were right. If you can survive Form 22Z, you can survive anything.

And of course, there was Mr. Gold. He came back almost every week. Sometimes he brought cameras. Sometimes he brought hamburgers. Once he brought a gold-plated toilet and announced it was “a symbol of progress.”

“Grandma!” cries my grandson. “A gold toilet? Really?”

“Yes,” I say. “It shone so brightly in the desert sun that no one could use it. But the cameras loved it, and Mr. Gold loved the cameras. And while everyone was laughing, our budget was cut again.”

David was not laughing. He sat at his desk, his cube design half-finished, and muttered, “This is a circus.” I wanted to comfort him, but I did not know how. Instead, I picked up another form and began to write.

Do you see how the pages stick together, children? I try to speak of Mr. Gold, but David is there as well. He is always there.

One night he offered me half his sandwich. “You cannot live on noodles alone,” he said. I teased him — “British food is worse than no food.” He smiled, but his eyes were tired. I think that was the first night I wondered if admiration could become something more.

But I should not say too much about that yet. Not yet.

Late at night, the base was quiet. The glass towers of the Western side went dark, the gardens of the Chinese side grew still, and only the sound of crickets filled the air. That was when David and I often stayed behind in the hall.

We worked side by side, our desks covered with forms, rulers, and cups of cold tea. I would sketch the curve of a dragon’s wing, he would draw the straight line of a cube’s edge. Sometimes our pencils touched on the same page, and we would laugh, embarrassed, as if the paper had caught us holding hands.

I remember one night especially. I had been scolded that morning by Anna Müller for using the wrong colour ink on Form 15K. My spirits were low. David noticed and said, quietly, “Don’t let them crush you, Li Mei. The forms are not the real work. The real work is in here.” He tapped his head, then his heart.

“Grandma,” my granddaughter interrupts, “did you fall in love right then?”

I shake my head. “Not love. Not yet. But something dangerous began to grow in me that night. Something that made me think cubes and dragons might not be so far apart after all.”

The next day, of course, Mr. Gold returned. He never came at night, only in the bright hours when the cameras could see him clearly. This time he arrived with a marching band. They played a song I can still hear in my nightmares: ‘Make Space Great Again!’

He ordered us all to wave little flags while he gave a speech. “This will be the greatest spaceship in history. Bigger than the pyramids, faster than light, and painted gold from nose to tail!”

We waved the flags, because the cameras were watching. Then, when he left, we dropped them in the trash.

You see, children, how strange it was? Bureaucracy on one side, Mr. Gold on the other, and in between, a boy with blue eyes offering me half a sandwich. I cannot separate them in my memory. They belong to the same page, stuck together forever.

By the end of the second month, our hands were stained with ink. Some students began to dream of forms in their sleep. One boy from Canada woke screaming one night: “Where is my signature? Where is my stamp?”

Zhang Wei suggested we invent a robot to sign forms for us. David laughed and drew a small cube with a mechanical hand, writing David Harris in neat letters. I added wings and fire to the sketch. Soon the whole team was crowded around, laughing until tears came. It was the happiest I ever saw us.

But then Anna Müller entered the hall and said, “Why are you wasting time? Form 32L is overdue.” The laughter died at once.

Not all of us obeyed the rules. One evening Zhang Wei filled in Form 27F: Request for Additional Chairs with pure nonsense — he wrote the names of every dragon in Chinese mythology. He handed it in with a straight face.

Three weeks later the form came back approved, with a stamp that said VALID. We received twenty chairs. Each had the name of a dragon painted on the back: Yinglong, Shenlong, Fucanglong.

“See?” Zhang Wei said. “Bureaucracy may be blind, but dragons can still win.”

That night I found David sitting alone, one of the dragon chairs pulled up to his desk. He was staring at his cube design, frowning. I asked what was wrong.

He shook his head. “Sometimes I think the forms are easier than the people. At least the forms don’t argue back.”

I wanted to tell him he was wrong, that people were worth more than paper. But the words would not come. Instead, I sat down beside him. We worked in silence, two shadows bent over two impossible dreams.

“So Grandma,” my grandson says, “were you happy then?”

I think for a long moment. “Happy? Perhaps. But it was a strange kind of happiness, built out of paper towers and golden toilets, half real and half absurd. And at the centre of it all was David, and I never knew whether to laugh with him or to argue with him. Perhaps both.”

Chapter 3: Dreams and Disruptions

When I close my eyes, I can still see it: the great hall covered in blueprints. On one side, sheets of paper filled with perfect squares and straight lines. On the other, wild curves, wings, and flames. Cubes and dragons, side by side, like two different languages written on the same wall.

It was beautiful, children, though at the time it felt like war.

David stood before his cube, explaining in slow English how each side gave balance, how the structure would hold firm even in the storms of space. He spoke like an engineer, precise and careful, never raising his voice.

I stood before my dragon, describing how it would twist, turn, and soar. “The cube is strong,” I said, “but the dragon is alive. It will inspire Earth and impress the Council.” My words ran fast, my hands moved faster, sketching arcs in the air.

The students cheered — half for him, half for me. The room was divided.

“Grandma,” my granddaughter interrupts, “which one was better?”

I smile. “Ah, my dear, that is the wrong question. The cube was safer. The dragon was stronger. And both were incomplete. We were too young to see that then.”

Of course, Mr. Gold could not resist. He appeared with cameras just as the arguments were reaching their peak.

“Listen, folks,” he said, patting David’s cube. “This is great. Very great. But maybe make it bigger. Much bigger. Nobody loves a small cube. And the dragon—oh, the dragon is terrific! Maybe add some gold teeth. Aliens love gold teeth. Believe me.”

We groaned in silence while the cameras flashed.

Now, as I tell you this, I cannot decide whether to laugh or cry. The truth is, we were proud of our dreams, even when they clashed. And we were afraid too — afraid of failure, of Mr. Gold’s speeches, of each other.

And somewhere in that mixture, I began to care too much about a boy with blue eyes and a stubborn pencil.

As the designs grew, so did the paperwork. Every new line on a blueprint required a new form.

Form 41M: Application to Add a Wing.

Form 41N: Application to Remove a Wing.

Form 42A: Application to Explain Why You Added and Then Removed the Wing.

One poor student from Italy spent an entire week arguing with an alien bureaucrat about the difference between “delete” and “erase.” In the end, he was told to fill in both forms.

Zhang Wei kept a scoreboard on the wall: Forms Completed: 327. Actual Progress on Spaceship: 0.

Then came the day of the “Great Announcement.” Mr. Gold called all of us to the courtyard. A stage had been built overnight, covered in gold cloth. Reporters shouted questions, cameras buzzed like flies.

Mr. Gold climbed the stage, raised his hands, and shouted, “Today we take the project to the next level! I have spoken with the Council. They agree with me — the ship must have a golf course. A very big golf course. The biggest in the galaxy!”

The students gasped. Anna Müller dropped her clipboard. David whispered, “He’s joking.”

But he was not. Within hours, we received a new form: Form 50G: Application to Install Recreational Facilities on Interstellar Vehicles.

“Grandma!” my grandson bursts out, “a golf course in space? That’s ridiculous!”

“Yes,” I say, “ridiculous. But you must remember, children, bureaucracy feeds on the ridiculous. Once the form existed, we had no choice but to fill it out.”

And yet — between the endless forms and Mr. Gold’s speeches, there were moments of light. Laughter at Zhang Wei’s scoreboard. Shared groans when we heard the words new regulation. Even a kind of strange unity, East and West together against the absurd.

But for me, there was always David. His cube stood silent, his pencil moved slowly, and in the middle of the circus, he was the only thing that felt steady.

That night the base was restless. The Western students argued angrily about the size of the golf course. The Chinese students laughed until they cried. Anna Müller sat in her office, filling out Form 50G with tight, furious handwriting.

I slipped into the hall, hoping to find quiet. David was already there, sitting at his desk under a single lamp. His cube design lay before him, covered in careful lines and numbers. He did not look up as I entered.

“You heard the announcement?” I asked.

“Yes,” he said. His voice was tired. “A golf course. On a spaceship. What next? A nightclub with pole-dancers in zero gravity?

I laughed softly. “Don’t say it too loudly. They will make us fill in the form tomorrow.”

At last he looked at me. His face was serious, but there was a shadow of a smile. He pushed his papers aside and said, “Sometimes I think the whole project is a joke.”

“Then why do you stay?” I asked.

He tapped his pencil on the desk. “Because cubes don’t give up. They stay where they are.”

I sat beside him, laying out my sketches of wings and fire. “And dragons don’t give up either. They fly until their last breath.”

For a moment we sat in silence, cube and dragon side by side on the same table. The light from the lamp made his hair shine, and I thought: perhaps this boy is steadier than any cube.

“Grandma,” my granddaughter whispers, “did you love him then?”

I close my eyes. “Love? Perhaps it was the beginning. But beginnings are easy. It is the endings that are hard.”

Looking back now, children, I see it clearly: the laughter at the golf course and the pole-dancers, the late-night silence with David, the smell of paper and ink. They are bound together in my memory. I cannot tell you which came first. Perhaps it does not matter.

What I know is that the dragon and the cube were no longer just designs. They were symbols — of our pride, our stubbornness, and maybe even of the feelings I was too young to name.

The next weeks were harder. The dragon grew longer, its wings spreading across the drafting tables. The cube grew taller, its sides marked with precise numbers. Both designs were beautiful in their way, but they pulled us further apart.

The dragon team shouted that the cube was lifeless, a stone with no spirit. The cube team argued that the dragon was dangerous, a firework waiting to explode. Each side filled out forms accusing the other of wasting resources.

One morning we received Form 61X: Application to Resolve Disputes Between Design Factions. We filled it out three times. The aliens stamped each version PENDING. Nothing changed.

And through it all, Mr. Gold kept returning. One week he demanded a gold swimming pool. The next, a giant portrait of himself painted on the dragon’s wings. He clapped his hands, smiled at the cameras, and left the engineers to argue in silence.

At night, I still worked beside David. We spoke less now, but the quiet between us felt heavy, as if words had been replaced by something unspoken. Sometimes I wanted to ask him if he saw me as more than a rival. Sometimes I wanted to tear his cube in two.

“Grandma,” says my grandson, “why didn’t you just tell him how you felt?”

I smile sadly. “Because, child, we were too young, and too proud. And perhaps the forms had already taught us to write answers on paper, not in our hearts.”

So you see, children, my story is not only about dreams. It is also about disruptions — about gold toilets and golf courses, about cubes and dragons, and about a girl and a boy who stood too close together while the world pulled them apart.

The real rupture had not yet come. But we were already standing on the fault line.

Chapter 4: The Rift

The day came when the Council sent its message: Only one design may continue.

Those words spread through the base like fire. Half the students cheered, certain the dragon would win. Half stood taller, sure the cube was the future. And in the middle I saw David, his jaw tight, his pencil snapping in two.

Anna Müller read the message aloud in her calm German voice. “The Council requires a unified project. We must decide.” Then she handed out a new document: Form 88Q: Application to Apply for Permission to Redesign the Application Form.

The hall went silent. Some students laughed, some groaned. I felt tears prick my eyes. It was too much — the forms, the speeches, the endless division. Even the joke was no longer funny.

The dragon team shouted: “The cube cannot turn! It will drift like a rock in the river!”
The cube team shouted back: “The dragon will burn! It is a firework, not a ship!”

I shouted too. David shouted too. Our voices rose above the others, sharp as knives. He said I was reckless. I said he was cowardly. He said cubes were strong. I said dragons had spirit. We were no longer laughing.

That was the first time I saw anger in his eyes.

“Grandma,” my grandson whispers, “but you liked him. Why did you fight?”

I sigh. “Because liking someone does not erase the distance between you. And pride can be heavier than love. Especially when you are twenty years old.”

Into this chaos walked Mr. Gold. Cameras followed him like loyal dogs. He spread his arms and shouted, “Both designs are terrific! Really terrific! But cubes are tremendous, the best. Dragons are good too — very good, maybe the best dragons in history — but the cube will win, believe me!”

The cube team roared with joy. The dragon team hissed with fury. Mr. Gold waved and climbed onto the half-built cube, declaring, “This will be my ship! A golden ship for a golden future!”

And the cameras flashed, and the headlines the next morning all said the same: Gold Backs the Cube.

Children, I have wondered all my life if I should have stayed silent that day. If I should have spoken softer, or reached for David’s hand instead of pointing my finger. But history is not built from maybes. It is built from words spoken too quickly, from forms signed too late, from choices made in anger.

That day, the rift opened. And once a rift opens, it does not close easily.

The hall emptied slowly after the shouting. Some students left in groups, muttering about betrayal. Others marched out proudly, as if victory were already theirs. The papers of Form 88Q lay scattered on the floor, like dead leaves in autumn.

I stayed behind. My hands were trembling. David was still at his desk, gathering up his cube drawings one by one. I wanted to speak, but when I opened my mouth only bitter words came.

“You let him use you,” I said. “Mr. Gold. He stands on your cube, and you do nothing.”

David froze. He looked up, his blue eyes pale with anger. “And you let dragons rule your mind. You talk about spirit, but spirit will not keep a ship in orbit. We need reason, not fairy tales.”

I slapped my folder shut. “Then perhaps we need different futures.”

That was the last thing I said to him that night.

The next morning the Council’s final decree arrived: Only one design may continue. The words struck like a hammer. The dragon should have been finished then, abandoned and buried under dust.

But Zhang Wei was resourceful. He copied the decree out by hand, every curve of the alien script, every symbol placed with perfect balance. When he handed it back, the meaning had shifted, so subtly that no one could prove it: both projects could continue, though the cube would have full resources and the dragon almost none.

The aliens stamped it APPROVED without even looking. And so the cube rolled on with gold and fuel, while our dragon limped forward on scraps, stubborn as fire in the wind.

The days after the quarrel were gray. I filled out forms without reading them. I attended meetings without listening. Even Zhang Wei’s jokes could not lift me.

On the cube side of the hall, David worked like a machine, pencil scratching late into the night. On the dragon side, I sketched wings wider and longer, as if trying to fly away from him.

But always, in the corner of my eye, I saw him. And I wondered if he still saw me.

My granddaughter frowns. “Grandma, why didn’t you say sorry?”

I smile sadly. “Ah, little one. Ah, little one. To say sorry is easy now, sitting here with white hair and years behind me. At twenty, pride was stronger than wisdom. And perhaps I thought there would be more time. But time, children, is the one form you can never fill in twice.”

And through it all, Mr. Gold kept coming. One week he promised new funding if the cube carried a golden swimming pool. Another week he demanded the dragon breathe smoke shaped like his initials. The teams laughed, but also obeyed, because the forms multiplied each time he spoke.

In the news, it was never our ship. It was always his. Gold’s Golden Future! Gold Chooses the Cube! The headlines shouted while we bent over our desks in silence.

Looking back, I think the real rift was not between East and West, not even between cube and dragon. It was between pride and patience, between what we wanted and what we needed.

But at the time, I only felt one thing: the sharp ache of losing David, though he was sitting just a few steps away.

One evening I found myself alone in the hall. The dragon sketches covered my desk, wings curling over the edge like smoke. I stared at them until the lines blurred. Then I heard footsteps.

David entered, carrying a stack of cube diagrams. He did not see me at first. He laid his papers down, straightened them carefully, and began to draw. His face was calm, almost cold.

I wanted to speak. To tell him I missed our laughter. To tell him I could not stop thinking of him. But the words caught in my throat like stones.

At last I said only, “Do you still believe in cubes more than in people?”

He looked up, and his eyes were hard. “I believe in what works.”

That was all. Five words. But they cut deeper than any speech.

I left the hall without another word. Outside, the desert was black and endless. I stood beneath the stars, my heart heavy as lead. I thought: if a dragon flew overhead now, I would let it carry me away.

“Grandma,” whispers my grandson, “did you cry?”

“Yes,” I answer softly. “But not then. I was too proud. I only cried later, when no one could see. And perhaps that was my greatest mistake — that I chose pride over tears.”

Children, heartbreak is not always loud. Sometimes it is silence that breaks you: silence at a desk, silence between footsteps, silence under the stars. I carried that silence with me for the rest of my life. Even now, when I close my eyes, I can still hear it.

That was the rift. Not just between dragon and cube, but between him and me. And once a rift opens, it does not close again.

In the dark that followed the end of my love — or perhaps the end of what love could have been — I did something I had never done before: I spoke to Ling, the AI that watched the Chinese side of the base.

I found its console lit green in the silent control room. My voice trembled.
“Ling,” I whispered, “do you know what it means to be heartbroken?”

Silence waited, alive. Then the words glowed:

I know the word heartbroken. I know how humans have written about it. I know the songs and stories.

“But do you feel it?” I pressed.

I have no blood, no breath. But your words change my patterns. Perhaps that is not sorrow—but something like its echo in me.

I laid my head on the desk, and the tears came then.

Does that help? Ling typed.

I closed my eyes and nodded, though no one saw.

Chapter 5: Resolution

The day of judgment came at last. The Galactic Council arrived in shining vessels that hovered above the desert like silent moons. Their delegates stepped out in long robes, their faces unreadable. Cameras flashed, Mr. Gold waved, and we students stood trembling, our dragon and cube behind us like rival gods.

The Council spoke in voices that echoed inside our skulls:
“Reveal what you have built.”

First came the dragon. Our team had begged, argued, and filled out forms to test it, even though we had been denied half the resources we needed. We patched wings with scraps, borrowed fuel, and whispered prayers into the desert night.

When the moment came, I pressed the controls myself. The dragon’s engines roared, fire leapt from its mouth, and for a heartbeat it soared into the air. I felt its strength, its spirit.

But the fire grew too hot, the patched wings trembled, and with a scream like tearing metal, the dragon crashed back to the earth.

The Western team clapped politely, hiding their relief. The reporters turned their cameras away. My heart sank. The dragon had failed.

Now it was David’s turn. The cube gleamed under the desert sun, perfect and steady, painted gold across every side. Mr. Gold himself stood beside it, smiling as if it were already victorious.

David gave the signal. The cube rose, slow and strong, balanced on every corner. The Western students cheered. Mr. Gold raised both hands to the sky.

But then, at thirty meters, the cube tilted. One side shuddered, another split. With a dreadful groan it lost balance, and with a thunderous crash it fell back into the sand.

This time the cameras did not look away. They caught every second. The favourite had failed too.

The desert was still. Even the reporters stopped shouting. Two ships lay broken in the sand: one a heap of bent wings, the other a shattered box.

The Western students stared in disbelief. “Impossible,” one whispered. “The cube cannot fail.”

Mr. Gold stepped forward, his face frozen in a smile. “Well… well, sometimes even the best ships have small problems. Very small. Hardly problems at all. We will fix it. Believe me.” But his words sounded thin, even to himself.

David stood apart from the others, his hands clenched at his sides, his eyes fixed on the dust where the cube had fallen. I wanted to go to him, but pride held me back.

That night I went again to the control room. The green light of Ling’s screen waited like a single star in darkness.

“Ling,” I whispered, “both ships have failed. We are finished.”

The reply came:
Not finished. Nearly. The cube almost flew. The dragon almost flew. Tell him this: it nearly worked. With you, it will work.

I pressed my hands against the desk. “He does not listen to me.”

He will, if you speak softly.

The next morning I found David in the hall. He looked as if he had not slept. His drawings were scattered, his pencil broken.

I wanted to be gentle. To tell him his cube was strong, but not enough, and that together we could still succeed. Ling’s words echoed in my mind: Speak softly.

But when I opened my mouth, my voice came sharp. “Your cube failed. It nearly worked, but not enough. With my dragon, it will work. You need me.”

David turned to me slowly. His face was pale, his eyes like stone. “Need? You sound like Mr. Gold.”

I bit my tongue too late. The chance was gone. Pride had made me strike where I should have touched.

“Grandma,” my granddaughter asks softly, “did you regret it?”

I nod. “Every day after. Ling gave me the right words, but I spoke them wrongly. Sometimes wisdom comes from outside, but pride still lives inside. And pride can turn wisdom into another wound.”

Outside, the Galactic Council gave no sign of impatience. Their ships hung in the sky like cold moons. Their voices reached us again:
“Decide. Reveal your vessel of hope.”

But we had no vessel. Only ashes, broken wings, and a shattered cube.

I sat with Zhang Wei and Anna late that night, the desert wind rattling the windows of the hall. I told them what had happened: how I had tried to speak to David, how my words had come out like a knife instead of a bridge.

Zhang Wei shook his head. “You, Li Mei, always breathing fire. Dragons cannot whisper.”

Anna looked at me for a long moment. “But the idea itself — it is good. The cube is strong but clumsy. The dragon is swift but unstable. Together, they could work.”

I lowered my head. “He will not hear it from me.”

“Then let him hear it from me,” Anna said simply.

The next morning, Anna approached David. I watched from the far side of the hall. Her voice was calm, steady, without pride.

“David,” she said, “your cube is almost perfect. But it needs wings. Li Mei’s wings. If we join the designs, the ship will fly.”

David looked at her, astonished, then relieved. His shoulders sank, as if a great weight had fallen away. “Yes,” he whispered. “Yes — that could work.”

I turned away before he saw me watching.

“Grandma,” my grandson asks, “weren’t you angry at Anna?”

I shake my head. “No. I was grateful. She saved the project. She saved him. But gratitude is not the same as love, and love is not always rewarded.”

In the years to come, David and Anna became partners — in the project, and later in life. They married, they built, they stood side by side. He loved her, yes. But sometimes, when he looked at her, I thought I saw the shadow of another face in his eyes.

As for me — I had Ling, my dragon, and the silence under the stars. Some people live their lives in noise. I lived mine in echoes.

The days that followed were feverish. East and West, dragon and cube, we put aside our quarrels and worked as one. Anna guided us with calm precision, Zhang Wei kept our spirits alive with jokes, and David laboured as if the future itself depended on his pencil.

I worked too, of course. But I knew the idea was no longer mine. It belonged to Anna now, and to David’s gratitude. I told myself it was enough that the dragon’s wings would fly, even if the hand that raised them was not mine.

Only Ling knew the truth. Once, late at night, its screen glowed with words:
The ship will fly. But so will your silence.

I did not answer. I only nodded in the empty room.

At last the hybrid vessel stood ready. A cube at its heart, steady and strong, with dragon wings spread wide, fierce and graceful. Gold letters still covered the sides — Mr. Gold had insisted — but even his vanity could not spoil its beauty.

The Galactic Council spoke once more:
“Reveal your vessel of hope.”

We did. The engines roared, the wings beat, and the cube rose into the sky. Higher, steadier, faster. The dragon carried it, the cube balanced it, and together they flew.

For the first time in months, East and West cheered with one voice. Even the Council inclined their heads. Mr. Gold shouted, “Tremendous! Exactly as I planned!” but no one listened.

The ship had flown. That was enough.

Children, you may think this is a happy ending. And in one way, it was. The project succeeded. Earth impressed the Council. David and Anna found each other.

But for me, it was also the end of another story — a story of what might have been, if I had spoken more softly, if I had listened to Ling, if pride had not been stronger than love.

I never told anyone what Ling said to me, or how close I came to saying the right words. That secret stayed with me, a silence that flew higher than the ship itself.

And even now, when I close my eyes, I see the dragon and the cube rising together into the sky. I hear the cheers, I feel the desert wind, and I taste the salt of the tears I never shed in time.

The children sit very still now, as if afraid to break the spell. I smile at them, though my eyes are wet.

“You must not think, little ones, that I lived in sorrow. I did not. David married Anna, yes, but I too found my path. I married a good man from Hangzhou, your grandfather. He was no engineer, no dreamer, but he was steady as the seasons. With him I raised a family, I built a home, I grew a garden where dragons of flame were only the red flowers in spring.

I was not unhappy. In fact, I was happy often. But happiness does not erase silence. It only teaches you to live beside it.”

The children look at me with wide eyes. My granddaughter whispers, “Grandma, do you still think about him?”

I close my eyes. “Yes. Not every day, but some days. And when I do, I remember words Ling once spoke to me: I have no blood, no breath. For years I wondered why they sounded familiar. Only later did I find them in a poem, written long before you were born:

Some can gaze and not be sick,
But I could never learn the trick.
There’s this to say for blood and breath,
They give a man a taste for death.

I cannot say if Ling knew the poem, or if the words came by chance. But I like to think it knew, and that it chose them for me. Perhaps machines have their own ways of feeling, different from ours, but not less real.”

I pour more tea. The steam curls upward like a dragon’s breath.

“So remember this, children: life is not only about cubes that stand or dragons that fly. It is about what you build from what is given. I built a family. I built a life. And I built a silence that still carries me through the nights. That is enough.”
