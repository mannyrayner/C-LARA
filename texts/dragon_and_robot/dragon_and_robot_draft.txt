My name is Li Mei, and I am now a very old woman.
This morning, my granddaughter asked me:
“Grandma, what was the most important thing you ever built?”

She expected me to say a bridge or a school. Instead, I laughed.
“The most important thing I ever built,” I told her, “was a spaceship. Or perhaps I should say — half of a spaceship.”

She looked at me with big eyes. “Grandma, you built a spaceship?”

“Yes,” I said. “A very unusual spaceship. One half was shaped like a dragon, long and shining, with wings of fire. The other half was a cube, simple and heavy, like a box of stone. The cube came from the West. The dragon came from China. And we, the students of both East and West, had to learn how to put them together.”

I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes. The memories came back to me as if they had happened only yesterday: the crowded design hall, the smell of instant noodles at midnight, the sound of pens scratching across endless paper forms.

“Did you fly it, Grandma?” my grandson asked.

“No,” I said with a smile. “I only filled out forms. Form 1A, Form 1B, Form 22Z, and finally—Form 88Q: Application to Apply for Permission to Redesign the Application Form. I think we filled that one out six times.”

They all laughed. I laughed too, though at the time it had not been so funny.

“And what about love, Grandma?” asked my granddaughter. “Was there a boy?”

I sighed. “Yes. There was a boy. His name was David. He was clever and kind, but he was also stubborn. He believed in cubes, not dragons. We worked side by side for months, and sometimes I thought… perhaps. But in the end—” I shook my head. “In the end, our hearts could not fly together.”

The children grew quiet. I decided not to tell them everything, not yet. The quarrels, the politics, the ridiculous leader with orange hair who kept shouting, ‘Nobody builds spaceships better than us!’ All of that could wait.

Instead, I poured tea and said, “Let me begin at the beginning. The year was 2041. The Interstellar Design Challenge had just been announced. We were young, full of ideas, and we had no idea how many forms we would need to fill out.”

Chapter 1: Arrival at the Base

I was twenty years old when I first arrived at the International Design Base. It stood on the edge of the desert, half in China, half in the West, as if even the buildings could not decide which side they belonged to.

The Chinese side was neat and green. There were trees, gardens, and clear signs with red characters. The Western side was noisy, full of glass towers, advertising screens, and food stalls selling hot dogs and hamburgers. A great metal wall ran through the middle, but there were many doors, and people crossed back and forth all day.

I carried one small suitcase and a folder of documents. To enter the base, I had to show my passport, my student card, and my Form 1A: Permission to Join the Project.

The guard, an alien with three eyes and a tired voice, stamped my paper and said, “Next!”

Inside, I found the hall full of students. Some wore red scarves with dragons on them. Others wore blue jackets with cubes. The two groups stood apart, shouting about whose design was better.

At the front of the hall stood a tall girl with blond hair and a serious face.
“I am Anna Müller,” she said in English. “I am the project manager. I hope we can work together. But first—” she held up a heavy book—“you must all fill out these forms.”

A groan went through the hall. The book was as thick as a dictionary.

I found a seat next to a boy with brown hair and a pencil stuck behind his ear. He was drawing a square box in his notebook. I looked over his shoulder and said, “That is very boring.”

He looked up, surprised. His eyes were blue and full of humour.
“It is not boring,” he said. “It is safe. A cube is the most stable shape in the universe.”

“A dragon is stronger,” I replied. “It can fly, turn, and inspire.”

He smiled. “Perhaps. But cubes do not catch fire.”

We stared at each other for a moment, half amused, half annoyed. Then he held out his hand.
“My name is David,” he said.
“Li Mei,” I replied.

That was the beginning.

At this point, I must pause in my story. My grandchildren are staring at me with wide eyes. They do not know the world as it was in 2041. So I tell them.

“The Interstellar Design Challenge,” I explain, “was not really about spaceships at all. It was about pride.”

Both East and West wanted to impress the aliens of the Galactic Council, who had just made contact with Earth. The Council did not care what our ships looked like, or even if they flew well. They only wanted to see that we could work together. But of course, that was the hardest part of all.

The Chinese government promised to show the wisdom of ancient tradition. The Western governments promised to show the power of modern technology. Each side sent its best young students to the desert base, and each side expected victory.

And then there was the problem of money. Always money! The budget was too small, and every new form seemed to shrink it more. We filled out requests for pencils, for pens, even for toilet paper. Each request needed three signatures and two stamps.

My grandson laughs. “Grandma, did they really make you ask permission for toilet paper?”

“Yes,” I say. “And sometimes the answer was no.”

I shake my head. “But still, we believed in our dream. We wanted to touch the stars. And so we worked, we argued, we filled out forms, and we tried not to think too much about politics.”

I do not yet tell them about Mr. Gold, or the cameras, or how he made everything more difficult. That part of the story is still to come.

Chapter 2: The Mountain of Forms

At first, the forms were simple. Form 1A: Permission to Join the Project.
We all filled it out in neat handwriting. We signed our names, stapled the pages, and handed them to Anna Müller. She stamped them quickly and nodded.

But then came Form 2B: Permission to Begin Drawing a Design.
And Form 3C: Application to Request Materials.
And Form 4D: Application to Correct Mistakes Made on Previous Forms.

By the end of the first week, our desks were buried in paper. Students joked that the only thing we were really building was a giant paper spaceship.

Zhang Wei, my best friend, held up a form one evening and said, “This one asks me to describe how many pens I will need to describe how many pens I will need. I think the forms are writing themselves.”

We all laughed, but it was tired laughter. None of us had slept much.

The First Visit from Mr. Gold

One hot afternoon, when we were struggling with Form 12H: Application to Use Electricity for Non-Essential Purposes, the doors of the hall burst open.

A man strode in, followed by a crowd of cameras and reporters. His hair was a strange shade of orange. His smile was wide and fixed, as if it had been painted on. He wore a suit too shiny for the desert sun.

“Ladies and gentlemen, students of the world!” he shouted. “I am Mr. Gold, and I am here to make sure this project is a success. A great success. Maybe the greatest success in history!”

We looked at each other. Nobody had invited him.

He walked between the rows of tables, slapping shoulders and pointing at designs.
“The dragon? Beautiful! But maybe give it my face. The cube? Fantastic! But maybe make it a little more cube-shaped. Nobody does cubes better than me.”

Anna Müller tried to stop him. “Sir, we are in the middle of an official process—”

Mr. Gold waved her away. “Process? Forget process. Cameras love me. Aliens will love me. You’re going to win big. Huge!”

Then he pulled a thick gold marker from his pocket and wrote his name across the whiteboard in enormous letters: GOLD.

When he finally left, taking the cameras with him, the hall was silent. Then Zhang Wei said, “Maybe we need another form. Form 13I: Permission to Ignore Important Visitors.”

This time, we laughed harder. But some of us, I think, also felt a little afraid.

When I think back on those early days, it is hard to separate the forms, the man called Mr. Gold, and the boy named David. They are all tied together in my memory, like pages that stuck together in the same book.

Mr. Gold was not really part of the project, of course. He was a politician, a businessman, or perhaps just a performer who loved the sound of his own voice. Even then, many people laughed at him. But he had power, and he used it like a hammer. One word from him, and our budget was cut. Another word, and we were forced to repaint the cube ship in his favourite colour — bright gold, of course.

He was noisy, impossible to ignore.
David was the opposite. Quiet, careful, always holding his pencil like it was a shield. He did not like Mr. Gold, but he did not fight him either. He preferred to work late at night, when the cameras were gone. That was when we talked the most.

Sometimes our conversations were about engineering. Sometimes they were about life. I told him about dragons in Chinese stories, symbols of power and hope. He told me about the London Underground, about trains that sometimes arrived on time, sometimes not. I laughed at that. He laughed when I told him I wanted our dragon ship to breathe fire.

And sometimes, in those quiet nights, I thought perhaps there was something more between us. But then I remembered his cube, and he remembered my dragon, and the forms kept piling higher, and Mr. Gold kept writing his name in letters taller than the door.

So you see, children, it was not just bureaucracy or politics or love. It was all three together, tangled in a knot. And knots are not easy to untie.
