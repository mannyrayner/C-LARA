*The Dragon and the Robot — Outline*
*Prologue*

Old Li Mei introduces herself to grandchildren.

Joke about the most important thing she ever built being “half a spaceship.”

Sets up main motifs: dragon vs. cube, bureaucracy, David, Mr. Gold.

Grandchildren’s curiosity provides a natural frame.

*Chapter 1: Arrival at the Base*

Li Mei arrives at the East–West design base in the desert.

Contrast between Chinese and Western halves of the base.

First form: Form 1A.

Meeting Anna Müller (project manager) and David (cube advocate).

Children interrupt: “But Grandma, how did the contest even start?”

*Digression: Background*

Old Li Mei explains the Interstellar Design Challenge: aliens testing Earth’s cooperation.

Pride and politics driving both East and West.

Bureaucracy even for toilet paper.

Returns to story of meeting David.

*Chapter 2: The Mountain of Forms*

Forms multiply rapidly: escalating absurdity.

Zhang Wei provides comic relief.

First visit from Mr. Gold with cameras; his interference begins.

Li Mei reflects: memory of Mr. Gold tangled with memory of David.

Late-night conversations with David; cultural exchange, early romantic tension.

Grandchildren interrupt: “But weren’t you still just filling out forms?”

Old Li Mei: “Yes, yes, the order is not clear in my head… but the feeling remains.”

*Chapter 3: Dreams and Disruptions*

Li Mei describes the dragon design in detail; David presents the cube.

Cultural pride in both visions.

Mr. Gold imposes absurd modifications (gold paint, swimming pool).

Budgets cut, bureaucracy grows.

Li Mei digresses to recall a small kindness from David (sharing food, helping with calculations).

Children ask: “So did you fall in love?”

Old Li Mei hesitates, admits admiration that almost became love.

*Chapter 4: The Rift*

Decision point: only one design can be funded.

Fierce arguments between dragon and cube factions.

Li Mei and David quarrel bitterly — professional dispute spills into personal feelings.

Mr. Gold fans the flames for his own publicity.

Bureaucracy reaches peak absurdity (Form 88Q).

Old Li Mei interrupts herself with a reflection: “I have wondered all my life if I could have spoken differently.”

*Chapter 5: Resolution*

Galactic Council arrives, demanding completed forms before viewing ships.

Zhang Wei forges the last forms in beautiful calligraphy, comic twist.

Both dragon and cube fail separately at test.

Hybrid design (dragon + cube) finally succeeds.

Li Mei and David reconcile as teammates, not lovers.

*Epilogue*

Back in the present: Old Li Mei pours tea for her grandchildren.

Reflects that it was never about winning, but about learning to build together.

Remembers David with bittersweet fondness.

Grandchildren ask: “Grandma, if you could go back, would you change what you did?”

She smiles: “Perhaps not. The dragon and the cube still fly in my dreams.”
