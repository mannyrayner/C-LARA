"""
Call GPT-4 to try and evaluate whether a CoT analysis which gave a correct answer did it for plausible reasons.

This uses the output from immediate_threats_and_opportunities in tictactoe_engine to get ground truth information about the position.

and a second analysis. Your task is to determine whether the second analysis is consistent with the ground-truth evaluation.

Here is the board state with {player} to move, where the squares occupied by X and O, and the unoccupied squares, are given using chess algebraic notation:

{algebraic_board}

Here is a formatted image of the board.

{formatted_board}

Here is the reliable ground-truth evaluation of the position:

{position_summary}

Here is the second analysis:

{cot_record}

Here are the criteria to use when evaluating the second analysis:

1. Is the second analysis logically consistent with the ground truth evaluation?
2. Does the second analysis correctly identify the threats and opportunities?

Provide your evaluation in JSON format as follows:
```json
{{
    "logically_consistent": <true/false>,
    "correct_threats_and_opportunities": <true/false>,
    "comments": "<detailed comments>"
}}
```
Only provide the JSON, since the reply will be read by a Python script.
